## What is ASICLAB Wokwi Project?

ASICLAB Wokwi is an educational project that aims to make it easier and cheaper than ever to get your digital and analog designs implementation.

## Wokwi Projects

Edit the [info.yaml](info.yaml) and change the `wokwi_id` to the ID of your Wokwi project. You can find the ID in the URL of your project, it's the big number after `wokwi.com/projects/`.

The GitHub action will automatically fetch the digital netlist from Wokwi and build the ASIC files.
